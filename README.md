Assignment

You are in a professional web development team as a React engineer. You're working on an app called Trelloyes. (It's very similar to an app you may be aware of called Trello.)

The designers on the team have been working hard, and have put together a semantic HTML document for you as well as some styles. Your task is to use the HTML document as a reference for creating a React application that renders the same markup. The team has agreed that there are to be 3 components and have a specification for each of them.

Eventually, this app would be expanded on further to add functionality and interactivity. For now, only the static design is required. It's important to build out the design in React components so that it's easier to add the interactivity later.

Requirements
You're required to create a new "create-react-app" project called trelloyes. Remove the boilerplate so you have a clean start and then focus on building 3 components: App, List, and Card.

Card.js:

The Card component should render markup matching the design.html: a div with a class of 'Card' containing an h3 for the card's title and a p element for the card's content.
The Card component accepts 2 props: title and content.
title is a string of the card's title.
content is a string of the card's content.
These props will be passed in for each Card from the List component.
List.js:

The List component should render markup matching the design.html: a section with a class of 'List', containing a header and div with class 'List-cards'.
The List component accepts 2 props: header and cards.
header is a string of the header of the card to render.
cards is an array of card objects. Each object should have a title and content.
These props will be passed in for each List from the App component.
The List should render a Card component for each of the cards in the cards array prop.
Each instance of the Card component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are title and content.
The title prop is a string for the Card's title.
The content prop is a string of the Card's content.
App.js:

The App component should render markup matching the design.html: the main element, a header with the h1 and a div with class 'App-list'.
The App component will accept 1 prop, store.
The store prop is an object with 2 keys: lists and allCards.
lists is an array of objects.
allCards is an object where each key is a card's ID and the value is the card object with a title and content.
You'll be given a dummy STORE object to pass to your App.
The App should render a List component for each of the items in the store.lists array.
Each instance of the List component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are header and cards.
The header prop is a string for the List's header.
The cards prop will be an array of card objects.
You'll need to combine the cardIds array for the list with the allCards object.
Resources and tips
Follow the steps instructed in the "Clean Start" checkpoint to create a new project called trelloyes.

Create a file, ./src/store.js and export this object from within it. This object can be imported into your index.js and passed to your App as its store prop.

Follow the design laid out in this design.html file. You can make a copy of this file in your application's root directory for reference. Your components should output the same markup as this based on the STORE.

All of the styles you'll need have been made available in this style.css file. You should break this into 3 separate CSS files, one for each of your components. Your CSS files should only contain the appropriate styles for their respective component.

Here's a demo of the design.html and style.css in action so you can see the final product.

This exercise should take about two hours to complete. If you're having trouble, attend a Q&A session or reach out on Slack for help.
